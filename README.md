Welcome! This is a personal portfolio built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Projet will run by default on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be added in `pages/api/[endpoint].ts`.

The `pages/api` must be mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
